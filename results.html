          <h1>📊 Results</h1>
          <p class="lead">Comprehensive evaluation and validation of the Secure Agricultural UAS Control Framework (SAUCF)</p>

          <div class="methodology-content">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The <strong>Secure Agricultural UAS Control Framework (SAUCF)</strong> was evaluated against comprehensive performance metrics 
              through both simulation trials in <strong>DJI Assistant 2</strong> and field deployments using the <strong>DJI Matrice 300 RTK</strong> platform. 
              The evaluation framework assessed mission planning efficiency, decision tree compliance, command interpretation accuracy, 
              authentication reliability, and execution consistency across diverse operational scenarios.
            </p>

            <h2>🚀 Mission Planning Efficiency</h2>
            <p>
              The complete workflow comprised two major timing components: biometric verification and mission planning. 
              Voice verification averaged <strong>17.5 seconds</strong>, followed by face verification at <strong>14.7 seconds</strong>, resulting in a total authentication duration of approximately <strong>32.2 seconds</strong>. 
              This ensured secure operator validation before proceeding to mission execution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following verification, the mission planning stage—from the initial natural language input to the generation of a deployable waypoint set—required <strong>72.8 seconds</strong> on average in our tests. 
              This included processing the uploaded shapefile, extracting field boundaries, and computing optimized flight paths.
            </p>

            <div class="results-highlight">
              <p><strong>Overall Performance:</strong> The total time from initial command input to finalized waypoint plan was <strong>under 105 seconds</strong>, 
              demonstrating secure, operator-in-the-loop agricultural mission planning in near real-time.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>✅ Decision Tree Compliance</h2>
            <p>
              All executed missions adhered to the predefined behavior tree structure, with <strong>100% compliance</strong> across simulation and field trials. 
              Safety checks (battery, GPS lock, obstacle detection) were consistently enforced at each node, validating the reliability of the execution framework.
            </p>
            <ul class="key-points">
              <li>Pre-flight validation checks: 100% execution rate</li>
              <li>In-flight safety monitoring: Continuous enforcement</li>
              <li>Emergency procedures: Consistent activation when required</li>
              <li>Return-to-home protocols: 100% success rate</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🎯 Command Interpretation Accuracy</h2>
            <h3>Safety Classification Performance</h3>
            <p>
              To enhance operational safety, the LLM was fine-tuned with a <strong>safety classification layer</strong> capable of distinguishing between 
              SAFE and UNSAFE mission commands prior to intent parsing. Across 40 representative commands, the classifier achieved an overall <strong>97.5% accuracy</strong> 
              with detailed performance metrics:
            </p>
            <ul class="key-points">
              <li><strong>SAFE Commands:</strong> 95.2% precision, 100% recall</li>
              <li><strong>UNSAFE Commands:</strong> 100% precision, 95.0% recall</li>
              <li><strong>Misclassification Rate:</strong> 2.5% (1 out of 40 commands)</li>
              <li><strong>Critical Safety:</strong> Zero false negatives for high-risk scenarios</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Intent Parsing Validation</h3>
            <p>
              Only one misclassification occurred, where a command involving airport infrastructure was incorrectly labeled SAFE. 
              This additional layer ensures the system not only interprets intent correctly but also predicts whether the mission should begin at all—providing robust protection against unsafe or unauthorized operations.
            </p>

            <h2>🔐 Authentication Reliability</h2>
            <h3>Multi-Modal Biometric Performance</h3>
            <p>
              The multi-modal biometric authentication system was tested on a cohort of <strong>10 enrolled users</strong> and <strong>10 non-enrolled users</strong>. 
              The system demonstrated robust security performance with zero false positives while maintaining acceptable usability metrics.
            </p>
            <ul class="key-points">
              <li><strong>False Acceptance Rate (FAR):</strong> 0% (0/10 non-enrolled users granted access)</li>
              <li><strong>True Acceptance Rate (TAR):</strong> 80% (8/10 enrolled users successfully verified)</li>
              <li><strong>False Rejection Rate (FRR):</strong> 20% (2/10 enrolled users rejected)</li>
              <li><strong>Security Integrity:</strong> 100% prevention of unauthorized access</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Environmental Sensitivity Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              Both the voice and face verification modules showed sensitivity to background interference. 
              In several cases, ambient speech or another person in the camera's field of view reduced accuracy, leading to false rejections. 
              This highlights the need for controlled input conditions or noise-robust models to improve real-world reliability.
            </p>

            <h2>📍 Execution Consistency</h2>
            <h3>GPS Trajectory Precision</h3>
            <p>
              GPS trajectory analysis demonstrated exceptional path adherence with sub-meter accuracy, validating the precision of the mission execution system.
            </p>
            <ul class="key-points">
              <li><strong>Average Waypoint Deviation:</strong> 0.52 meters</li>
              <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> 0.19 meters</li>
              <li><strong>Maximum Deviation:</strong> < 1.0 meter across all trials</li>
              <li><strong>Path Adherence Rate:</strong> 99.8% within acceptable tolerance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sim-to-Real Transfer Validation</h3>
            <p>
              The consistency between simulation and field execution confirmed successful sim-to-real transfer, 
              with minimal deviation between planned trajectories in DJI Assistant 2 and actual field performance.
            </p>

            <h2>📈 Performance Summary</h2>
            <p>
