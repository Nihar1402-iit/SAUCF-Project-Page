<h2>3. Results</h2>
<p>
The <strong>Secure Agricultural UAS Control Framework (SAUCF)</strong> was evaluated against the metrics outlined in Section 2.7.2. 
Experimental validation included both simulation trials in <strong>DJI Assistant 2</strong> and field deployments using the <strong>DJI Matrice 300 RTK</strong> platform. 
The results are summarized below.
</p>

<h3>3.1. Mission Planning Efficiency</h3>
<p>
The complete workflow comprised two major timing components: biometric verification and mission planning. 
Voice verification averaged <strong>17.5 seconds</strong>, followed by face verification at <strong>14.7 seconds</strong>, resulting in a total authentication duration of approximately <strong>32.2 seconds</strong>. 
This ensured secure operator validation before proceeding to mission execution.
</p>
<p>
Following verification, the mission planning stage—from the initial natural language input to the generation of a deployable waypoint set—required <strong>72.8 seconds</strong> on average in our tests. 
This included processing the uploaded shapefile, extracting field boundaries, and computing optimized flight paths.
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <strong>Overall:</strong> The total time from initial command input to finalized waypoint plan was <strong>under 105 seconds</strong>, 
  demonstrating secure, operator-in-the-loop agricultural mission planning in near real-time.
</div>

<h3>3.2. Decision Tree Compliance</h3>
<p>
All executed missions adhered to the predefined behavior tree structure, with <strong>100% compliance</strong> across simulation and field trials. 
Safety checks (battery, GPS lock, obstacle detection) were consistently enforced at each node, validating the reliability of the execution framework.
</p>

<h3>3.3. Command Interpretation Accuracy</h3>
<p>
To enhance operational safety, the LLM was fine-tuned with a <strong>safety classification layer</strong> capable of distinguishing between 
SAFE and UNSAFE mission commands prior to intent parsing. Across 40 representative commands, the classifier achieved an overall <strong>97.5% accuracy</strong> 
(<strong>95.2% precision</strong> and <strong>100% recall</strong> for SAFE, and <strong>100% precision</strong> and <strong>95.0% recall</strong> for UNSAFE).
</p>
<p>
Only one misclassification occurred, where a command involving airport infrastructure was incorrectly labeled SAFE. 
This additional layer ensures the system not only interprets intent correctly but also predicts whether the mission should begin at all—providing robust protection against unsafe or unauthorized operations.
</p>

<h3>3.4. Authentication Reliability</h3>
<p>
The multi-modal biometric authentication system was tested on a cohort of <strong>10 enrolled users</strong> and <strong>10 non-enrolled users</strong>. 
As expected, none of the non-enrolled users were granted access. Among the enrolled users, <strong>8 out of 10</strong> were successfully verified, 
corresponding to an effective acceptance rate of <strong>80%</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Both the voice and face verification modules showed sensitivity to background interference. 
In several cases, ambient speech or another person in the camera’s field of view reduced accuracy, leading to false rejections. 
This highlights the need for controlled input conditions or noise-robust models to improve real-world reliability.
</p>

<h3>3.5. Execution Consistency</h3>
<p>
GPS trajectory analysis showed an average waypoint deviation of <strong>0.52 meters</strong> with a standard deviation of <strong>0.19 meters</strong> 
between planned and executed paths in field trials, confirming precise path adherence.
</p>

<h3>3.6. Summary</h3>
<p>
Overall, the results demonstrate that <strong>SAUCF</strong> achieves:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low-latency mission planning</li>
  <li>Reliable intent parsing</li>
  <li>Robust biometric authentication</li>
  <li>Safe and consistent execution across simulation and field environments</li>
</ul>
<p>
These findings validate the framework’s ability to deliver secure, operator-friendly, and mission-reliable agricultural UAS operations.
